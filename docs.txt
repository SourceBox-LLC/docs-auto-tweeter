This flexibility enables you to explore complex topics, retrieve detailed insights, or address highly specific use cases that may not be covered by the default prompts.



Custom prompts are ideal when you want precise answers, perform in-depth analysis, or interact with your data in a way that aligns with your specific project requirements.
